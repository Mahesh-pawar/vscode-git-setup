Step 1 : Download GitHub Desktop Application to manage your Project (Git Repository)

  From Link :	https://desktop.github.com/ 
		 
Step 2 : Signup or Signin to your GitHub Account.

  From Link :    https://github.com/		

Step 3 : Create a new repository to Manage your project.
         You can find a green button at right sidebar (+ New repository) to create new repository.
		 
		 If you already have a repository in your account then skip it.

Step 4 : Now goto your desktop app and login with your GitHub Credentials i.e your email and password.

Step 5 : At the left Top your Desktop app you can find  "+" in GitHub Desktop.
    a) Click on the +. 
    b) click on clone.
    c) Select your repository.
    d) Clik on bottom button.
    e) select a location to save repository.
		 
Step 6 : now you can see a copy of your repository is available to your desktop at the location you choose to save repository.
         you can (make and save) any change to your project from your desktop repository.

Step 7 : To test how it's work create a file inside your Desktop repository which is also called  local repository. 

Step 8 : Now open Git Shell.
         a) Right click on repository from Desktop GitHub
         b) Select Open in Git Shell. 
        
Step 9 : To work with Git shell you need to learn some Easy shell commands.	
         Have a look about repository  Branch.
		 
		 Branch : To work with Your Team you need to create seprate branchs for each member of your team.
				  So that member can make any changes to his branch without changing the master copy.
		          
				  For testing purpose branchname = test1;
				  
    1)git branch branchname (To create New Branch eg : test1).
    2)git checkout branchname (Goto the branch or select/switch the branch eg: test1).
    3)git status (check status of current branch).
    4)git add --a (to untrack/new changes).
    5)git commit -m 'message' (to make changes point you can revert or these points).
    6)git push origin test1 (push Commit to the origin / master ,sync your branch with Master Copy).
    7)git checkout master (goto master branch).
    8)git merge test1 (merge neeraj branch to master branch).
    9)git status (check status of master branch).
    10)git push (push all the updates).
    12)git revert <commitid>
    11)git reset --hard
		
These above some basic commands to work with your repository using git shell.
Now it's time to test these commands on git shell.
		
You can find more commands on Google,Git documentation or other git Shell related tutorials.
